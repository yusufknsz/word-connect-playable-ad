# Word Connect - Playable Ad Case Study

This project is a **Playable Ad** prototype developed as a case study for Playable Factory. It replicates the core mechanics of a "Word Connect" style puzzle game using modern web technologies.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features
* **Drag & Drop Mechanics:** Smooth interaction for connecting letters.
* **Dynamic Level System:** Levels are generated based on JSON data (configurable words and grid).
* **Tutorial Hand:** An animated "Ghost Hand" guides the user (built with GSAP).
* **Input Locking:** Prevents accidental interactions during animations or wrong guesses.
* **Visual Feedback:** Shake effects for wrong answers and visual cues for selected letters.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **PixiJS (v7):** For high-performance 2D rendering.
* **GSAP (GreenSock):** For complex animations (hand movement, UI shakes, scaling).
* **Webpack:** For bundling and asset management.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Modular, OOP-based architecture (`Wheel`, `Board`, `Game` classes).

## 🚀 Optimization
* Assets are optimized for fast loading (essential for playable ads).
* Clean code principles and OOP structure used for maintainability.
